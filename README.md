# Talk-I
A Hackathon project


# Scope
Make the action of asking something in a Talk may be difficult for some shy people. Thinking on them we made an easy and better way to break this barrer. TalkI is a web platform that allow people to ask questions in live Talks and rate them. In the end of the talk the speaker will see the ones which was more rated and awnser them.

# How it works
 First you need to register with your facebook or tweeter. Once logged in, you will see the avaliable talks and all you have to do is get one. You can whatch through the streaming and ask questions, or you can read the ones that already have on the template and rate it. Be sure to only ask questions that hadn't been asked yet.

**Remember: a bot will allert you if it find a default question for this talk!**



# Runing project (to Devs only)
We need to have installed:
- NodeJS
- Angular CLI
- Any IDE


Runing:

1. open the folder `/TalkI/main/`
2. IF NOT INSTALLED `node_modules` just type:
 ```bash
 $ npm install
 ```
3. run app with 
 ```bash
 $ ng serve
 ```
4. Open the browser and go to `localhost:4200`

Commands in `ng`:
```bash 
 $ ng serve (run the app's server)
 ```
```bash
 $ ng g component teste (generate a new component named "teste")
```
```bash
 $ ng g module teste (generate a new module named "teste")
 ```
